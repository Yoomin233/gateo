**Attention:** Due to server response limitations, all http-related requests (querying historical orders, placing orders) will be unavailable unless you check the 'use http proxy' option at login([see below](#http-proxy)). Websockets are uneffected.

You can view as a visitor(click the checkbox 'I am a visitor'), or fill in the `api key` and `api secret` to start viewing your assets & trading. Your key and secret will only be used locally. Key and secret can be generated from [this link](https://www.gateio.co/myaccount/apikeys). **Act with caution!!**

## http-proxy
If this option is checked, all http requests will be send to my server for transparent proxy, to circumvent the CORS problem. If you are concerned about this, please uncheck this option at login.
